pip - Python Package Installer:

- `pip` is the standard package manager for Python.
- It allows you to install and manage additional libraries and dependencies that are not part of 
the Python standard library.

Common pip commands:
1. Install a package:
   pip install <package_name>

2. Install specific version:
   pip install <package_name>==1.2.3

3. Upgrade a package:
   pip install --upgrade <package_name>

4. List installed packages:
   pip list

5. Save dependencies to requirements.txt:
   pip freeze > requirements.txt

6. Install from requirements.txt:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

Useful for installing packages like `requests`, `fhir.resources`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.

'''
1. create virtual environment 
    python -m venv venv
2. activate the virutal env 
    .\venv\Scripts\activate

    once its activated you will see somthing like (venv)-- which tells you are in virtual env now

3. crate a file at root location as requirements.txt under that we can have module names which we want 
    to install like 
    requests
    fhir.resources

4. pip install -r requirements.txt  (this will install all the modules in one go to the virtual env)

5. you can install individually using the command pip install <packagename> also

6. use command pip list in your terminal and see if you have required packages there 

you are good to go now
